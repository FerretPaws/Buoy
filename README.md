# **HLS: Reborn**  
**Under new development!!**  

**HLS: Reborn** is a **mod manager** designed for **WEBFISHING** using **GDWeave**, based on the ill-fated original *Hook, Line, and Sinker*.  

This fork was created to keep this application **sustained and running**, while a new mod manager is planned for development in the future.

## **Using HLS: Reborn**  

If you're coming from the original **HLS**, there is a tool for **importing your old mods and settings** to this version.  

1. Download the **HLSRImporter.exe** from the [latest release](https://github.com/FerretPaws/HLSReborn/releases) tab.  
2. Run it **before launching HLS:Reborn for the first time**—your data will be transferred.  
3. You can delete the **Importer.exe** after the process is complete.  

**To install HLS:Reborn:**  
- Download the [latest release ZIP](https://github.com/FerretPaws/HLSReborn/releases), extract the .zip to anywhere you like, then run the .exe inside there. Simple as that! Just remember to keep it inside the folder it extracts from!
- You’ll need to go through a one-time setup process.  

⚠️ **Do NOT download the source code** unless you know what you’re doing.  

## **USING HLSR ON LINUX OR STEAM DECK**
- Follow the guide **[here](https://github.com/FerretPaws/HLSReborn/blob/main/repores/LinuxGuide.md)**

## **Troubleshooting / Tips**  

- ❗ If you encounter any issues, try running the program as **administrator**.  
- ⚙️ You may need to install **[.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)** manually. While the installer attempts to automate this, it's not perfect.
- ⚙️ If the game runs without mods when you chose the modded run option, run WEBFISHING through Steam first and then go back to HLS:R and relaunch through there. (This is an uncommon issue)
