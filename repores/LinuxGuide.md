# How to Use Buoy on Linux and Steam Deck

## Buoy cannot be easily compiled directly on Linux but it can be run through Proton with some set-up shown below from the latest pre-compiled exe in Releases

This process has **not been tested by me**. The tests and screenshots are from **@dandestroys** on Discord. Huge thanks to them for their efforts!

This guide was written for HLS: Reborn and has not been adapted for the rebrand, it all applies the same and all directotry files are the same as before so this guide is still fully working and valid.

## To get the Save Manager working, follow this guide:

Follow these steps to configure the save manager to work with your setup:

1. **Navigate to the target directory:**  
   Locate the directory where Steam stores its compatdata. Use the following path, replacing `[HSLR_STEAM_ID]` with your app's unique Steam ID (note: Steam auto-generates these IDs for non-Steam games, so they will differ for each installation):  
   ```~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/[HSLR_STEAM_ID]/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming```

2. **Determine the Godot directory location:**  
   Find the Godot folder in the following path:  
   ```~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/3146520/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming```

3. **Create a symbolic link:**  
   Symlink the Godot folder from the path above (3146520) to the directory corresponding to your app's `[HSLR_STEAM_ID]`. Use the following command, replacing `[HSLR_STEAM_ID]` as needed:  
   ```ln -s ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/3146520/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/Godot```
         ```~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/[HSLR_STEAM_ID]/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/Godot```

4. **Verify the symlink:**  
   Confirm that the symlink was created successfully by navigating to the `[HSLR_STEAM_ID]` directory:  
   ```cd ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/[HSLR_STEAM_ID]/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming```
   Use ls -l to verify the Godot link points to the correct location.

5. **Flatpak users:**  
   If you are using Steam via Flatpak, note that the directory structure will differ. The equivalent path for Flatpak installations is typically:  
   ```~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/```

Once the symlink is correctly established, the save manager should function as expected. üéâ
